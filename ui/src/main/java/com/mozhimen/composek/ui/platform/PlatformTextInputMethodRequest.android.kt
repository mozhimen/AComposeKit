     * This method makes stricter ordering guarantees about the lifetime of the returned
     * [InputConnection] than Android does, to make working with connections simpler. Namely, it
     * guarantees:
     *  - For a given [PlatformTextInputMethodRequest] instance, only one [InputConnection] will
     *    ever be active at a time.
     *  - References to an [InputConnection] will be cleared as soon as the connection becomes
     *    inactive. Even if Android leaks its reference to the connection, the connection returned
     *    from this method will not be leaked.
     *  - On API levels that support [InputConnection.closeConnection] (24+), a connection will
     *    always be closed before a new connection is requested.
     *
     * Android may call [View.onCreateInputConnection] multiple times for the same session â€“ each
     * system call will result in a 1:1 call to this method, although the old connection will always
     * be closed first.
     *
     * @param outAttributes The [EditorInfo] from [View.onCreateInputConnection].
     *
     * @return The [InputConnection] that will be used to talk to the IME as long as the session is
     * active. This connection will not receive any calls after the requesting coroutine is
     * cancelled.
