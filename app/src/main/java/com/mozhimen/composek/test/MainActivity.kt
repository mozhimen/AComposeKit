Whether you choose to break through as a survivor or chase as a hunter, the tension never fades. This <strong><span style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\">in-depth guide for 2025</span></strong> will take a deep look at what makes Identity V truly unique - from the asymmetrical <span style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\"><strong>basic gameplay</strong></span>, to the flexible <span style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\"><strong>character system</strong></span>, to the highly strategic world of <span style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\"><strong>ranked matches</strong></span>. Whether you are a new player or a returning player, this guide will help you understand the game completely.</p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\"><span class=\\\"otl-emoji\\\"><img src=\\\"https://static-cdn.manabuy.com/wz_20250324103741/identity%20v_20250328095328/202504141633_202504141633.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"430\\\" /></span></h2>\\n<h2 class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">\uD83E\uDD8BBasic gameplay - What Happens in a Match?</h2>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">Five players are mainly divided into two camps: one player plays the hunter, and the other four players play the survivors, who can choose to play different roles. The hunter's goal is to kill all the survivors before they escape by chasing them and sending them to the carnival chair. However, the survivor's goal is to escape through two exits after decoding five cipher machines, or escape through the dungeon if there is only one survivor left and at least two cipher machines have been decoded.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">Hunters win by eliminating survivors; if the hunter fails to eliminate survivors, but &ge;3 survivors escape, the survivors win. Game rewards depend on the game mode and the player's performance. Survivors can choose to watch the game after being eliminated.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">There are <a href=\\\"https://www.personality-database.com/profile?pid=2&amp;cid=11&amp;sub_cat_id=4046\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\"><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>multiple characters</strong></span></a> for players to choose from in the game, each with its own unique abilities. Hunters also have \\\"secondary skills\\\", which can assist hunters in hunting survivors in the game, but survivors can also use the map terrain to gain advantages.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">There are four currencies in the game: clues, fragments, inspirations, and echoes. Clues can unlock characters and decorations; fragments can buy skins and accessories; inspirations are used in the lottery system; <a href=\\\"https://manabuy.com/identity-v\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\"><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>echoes can be purchased with real money</strong></span></a> and can buy most items.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\"><img src=\\\"https://static-cdn.manabuy.com/wz_20250324103741/identity%20v_20250328095328/202504141630_202504141631.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"460\\\" /></p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\"><span class=\\\"otl-emoji\\\">\uD83D\uDD6F\uFE0F</span>Inner Personality Network: How to allocate 120 points most cost-effectively?</h2>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">\\\"Inner Personality Network\\\" (also known as \\\"Personality\\\") It can give both camps additional talents in the game. Different personalities give different conditional abilities in battle, which is also additional, for example, in order for survivors to highlight the lives of nearby teammates, hunters shorten the recovery time after attacking. However, there is a limit to the granting, and the maximum number of points that can be used is 120 points, which can be permanently obtained by participating in competitions.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\"><img src=\\\"https://static-cdn.manabuy.com/wz_20250324103741/identity%20v_20250328095328/202504141656_202504141656.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"472\\\" /></p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\"><span class=\\\"otl-emoji\\\">\uD83C\uDFC6</span>Ranked Matches - Character Points &amp; Ranks</h2>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">\\\"Fifth Personality\\\" has two ranking systems: character points and ranks, which are valid for a specific time period in the ranked match.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"otl-paragraph\\\">Character points are obtained by playing a specific character, which determines the leaderboard position. Points vary from character to character, and will decrease over time, and reset quarterly.
